## 📌 Usage

### Starting the Server & Connecting to Database

1. **Start XAMPP**  
   - Open **XAMPP** and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
   - Ensure MySQL is running to connect to the database.

2. **Connect the Backend to the Database**  
   - In your **backend** folder, make sure the database connection settings in `config/database.js` (or similar) are correctly set to your MySQL configuration.
   
3. **Run the Frontend**  
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the **frontend** folder using:
     
     cd frontend
     
   - Install dependencies (if packages are not installed):
     
     npm install
     
   - Build the project:
     
     npm run build
     
     This will compile your front-end project. **Note:** Changes made in development mode won't reflect unless you rebuild the project.

   - To run the server:
     
     npm run serve
     

4. **Run the Backend**  
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the **backend** folder.
   - Install dependencies (if packages are not installed):
     
     npm install
     
   - Start the backend server:
     
     npm run start
     
   - If the server doesn't start, try using:
     npm run dev

5. **Live Project Update**  
   - If changes made on the backend or frontend are not reflected on the live server, always remember to rebuild the frontend:
     npm run build

   - Then restart the frontend and backend servers:
     npm run serve    # For frontend
     npm run start    # For backend
